- [ ] User should have All constrainst in a range With slider
- [ ] Results: Pareto front in ovjective space + Pareto fornt in decision space
- [ ] Design table  with all vaiables and smulated smaple set
- [ ]Include measuring metics( hypervolume, C-metrics, eclidea distance)
- [ ] add dropdown notes, to explain reuslts metics.

- [ ] Results: Save temporal results to a folder and have a comparison and analysis page
- [ ]  Resulsts AI report page with template generation
